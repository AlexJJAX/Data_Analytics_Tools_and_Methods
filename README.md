# PSQL to Python

## What does the code do ?

This code snippet defines a function query_database that queries a PostgreSQL database using the provided database_uri and query and returns the result as a Pandas DataFrame.

To do this, the code first imports the necessary packages, including pandas, numpy, and sqlalchemy. It also sets up the database_uri with the appropriate credentials and port number.

Then, the function query_database is defined with two parameters: database_uri and query. Within the function, it uses sqlalchemy to create a connection to the database specified by the database_uri and then uses that connection to execute the provided query. The results are then stored in a Pandas DataFrame called "df".

After that, the function refreshes the query result to get an up-to-date version and closes the database connection. Finally, the function returns the "df" DataFrame.

Finally, the code calls the query_database function with the provided database_uri and query, and the resulting DataFrame is assigned to the variable df.

## Where is it useful ?

This code can be useful for anyone who needs to connect to a PostgreSQL database, execute a query, and retrieve the results as a Pandas DataFrame. Some potential use cases could include:

Data analysts who need to perform data analysis on large datasets stored in a PostgreSQL database.
Data scientists who need to preprocess or clean data from a PostgreSQL database before using it for machine learning or statistical modeling.
Software developers who need to build applications that interact with a PostgreSQL database and require data retrieval for various use cases.
Anyone who needs to perform ad-hoc queries on a PostgreSQL database to answer specific business or research questions.
Overall, this code provides a flexible and efficient way to interact with PostgreSQL databases and retrieve data in a format that is easily manipulable and compatible with many data analysis and visualization tools.
